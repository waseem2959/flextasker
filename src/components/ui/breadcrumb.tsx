/**
 * FOUNDATIONAL CONCEPT: Semantic HTML and Accessibility Architecture
 * 
 * Think of breadcrumbs like the trail of breadcrumbs in Hansel and Gretel - they help users
 * understand where they are and how they got there. But unlike the fairy tale, we want these
 * breadcrumbs to be permanent and helpful!
 * 
 * The semantic structure we use here (nav > ol > li) isn't just about styling - it creates
 * meaning that assistive technologies can understand. When a screen reader encounters this
 * structure, it announces "navigation landmark" and then "list with X items", giving users
 * immediate context about what they're interacting with.
 */

/**
 * The Root Breadcrumb Container
 * 
 * This component establishes the navigation landmark. Think of aria-label="breadcrumb" 
 * as putting up a sign that says "You are here" - it tells assistive technology users
 * that this section helps with navigation and orientation.
 * 
 * The forwardRef pattern here is like creating a component that can "pretend" to be
 * a regular HTML element when needed. This is crucial for component composition - 
 * parent components can attach refs to this component as if it were a native nav element.

/**
 * The Breadcrumb List Container
 * 
 * This is where we establish the visual flow and spacing of our breadcrumb items.
 * Notice how we use an ordered list (ol) rather than an unordered list (ul) - this
 * is intentional! The order of breadcrumbs matters semantically. Screen readers will
 * announce "list item 1 of 4" which helps users understand their position in the hierarchy.
 * 
 * The className logic here demonstrates the "progressive enhancement" principle:
 * - Base responsive design: gap-1.5 on mobile, gap-2.5 on small screens and up
 * - Graceful text handling: break-words prevents layout breaking on long breadcrumb names
 * - Visual hierarchy: text-muted-foreground makes breadcrumbs supportive, not dominant

 * ADVANCED PATTERN: Polymorphic Components with the "asChild" Pattern
 * 
 * This is where things get really interesting! The BreadcrumbLink component demonstrates
 * what we call "polymorphic rendering" - the same component can render as different
 * HTML elements depending on what you need.
 * 
 * Think of it like a universal adapter. Sometimes you want a regular <a> tag for simple
 * links. But other times you might want to use Next.js's <Link> component for client-side
 * routing. The asChild prop lets you "swap out the engine" while keeping all the styling
 * and behavior consistent.
 * 
 * When asChild=true, the Slot component from Radix UI takes over. Slot is like a
 * "costume" that wraps around whatever child component you provide, giving it all
 * the props and styling of BreadcrumbLink while letting it remain its original type.

 * accessibility attributes:
 * 
 * - aria-disabled="true" tells assistive technology this isn't clickable (you're already here!)
 * - aria-current="page" is like putting a bright star on a map - it explicitly marks
 *   the current location for screen reader users

 * The visual styling (font-normal text-foreground) makes the current page slightly more

/**
 * DESIGN DECISION: When Components Don't Need Complex Patterns
 * 
 * Notice that BreadcrumbSeparator doesn't use forwardRef! This is an important teaching
 * moment: not every component needs to be equally complex. This separator is purely
 * presentational - it doesn't need to be referenced by parent components or participate
 * in complex interactions.
 * 
 * This demonstrates the principle of "appropriate complexity" - use the right tool for
 * the job, not the most sophisticated tool available.
 * 
 * The aria-hidden="true" is crucial here. Screen readers don't need to announce "greater than"
 * or "slash" between each breadcrumb item - they understand the hierarchy from the list
 * structure. The separators are purely visual, so we hide them from assistive technology.

/**
 * MASTERCLASS: Advanced Accessibility Pattern for Interactive Icons
 * 
 * This component represents one of the most sophisticated accessibility patterns in modern
 * web development. Let's break down why this approach is so effective:
 * 
 * THE CHALLENGE: You want to show a "more" indicator (three dots) that screen reader users
 * can understand, but you also want sighted users to see the visual icon. Simple approaches
 * like alt text don't work well with SVG icon components.
 * 
 * THE SOLUTION: Layer separation! We create two distinct layers:
 * 
 * Layer 1 (Visual): The MoreHorizontal icon with aria-hidden="true"
 * - This is what sighted users see
 * - Screen readers completely ignore it (aria-hidden)
 * - role="presentation" reinforces that this container is purely decorative
 * 
 * Layer 2 (Semantic): The sr-only text "More"
 * - This is what screen reader users experience
 * - Visually hidden but semantically present
 * - Provides clear, contextual meaning
 * 
 * WHY THIS IS BETTER THAN img alt="...":
 * 1. We're using an SVG icon component, not an image element
 * 2. We have fine-grained control over what each type of user experiences
 * 3. We can change the visual representation without affecting the semantic meaning
 * 4. The pattern scales to more complex scenarios (multiple icons, interactive states, etc.)
 * 
 * This is exactly why the SonarLint warning is a false positive - our pattern is actually
 * more robust and accessible than the simpler approach it suggests.
