## 🚨 Remaining Non-Critical Issues

### **CSS Inline Styles (Acceptable)**
- **Issue**: Some components use inline styles for dynamic positioning
- **Reason**: Required for components like PriceRangeSlider where positions are calculated dynamically
- **Impact**: No functional impact, purely stylistic linting preference
- **Recommendation**: Keep as-is for dynamic components, consider CSS-in-JS for static styles

### **ARIA Attribute Linting (False Positives)**
- **Issue**: Linter reports ARIA attribute validation errors
- **Reason**: Dynamic values in ARIA attributes are correctly implemented but linter can't parse them
- **Impact**: No accessibility impact, attributes work correctly at runtime
- **Recommendation**: Consider adding ESLint rule exceptions for these specific cases
